We plan on developing a library management system that categorizes songs not only by
traditional metrics (e.g., genre) but also by the emotions or experiences they evoke (e.g.,
happiness, motivation, relaxation) in people. Users can look for content based on what they want
to feel and experience by receiving personalized recommendations. They also have the
opportunity to input their choice of what emotions apply to a particular song if they feel like it's
necessary.

Scope of the Project
This program will be able to:
● Categorize music by genre and emotional tags (e.g., happy, energetic).
● Allow users to search for content based on what they want to experience.
● Implement a recommendation system that suggests content based on user's preferences.
● Provide an interface for users to tag content with emotions/experiences, and review
recommendations.
● Offers the option to develop a random list of songs for the user to listen to that can give
them the chance to listen to other genres that may not be present in the recommended list.
(Mainly for allowing users to experiment with their interests).

Will Not Do:
● Stream music or video content directly within the application.
● Integrate with external databases or APIs for content fetching.
